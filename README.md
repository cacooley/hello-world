# hello-world
This is the hello-world repository, purely for training on the GitHub process.

This is my first step in a much larger world. I am beginning the deep dive into coding and programming so I can enlarge my skillset beyond a tech-savy guy who is also skilled in video production. I want to develop holistic skills that allow me to becom a one-man-army in all things IT and Tech for businesses.
